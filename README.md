# augBentoMAT
Some scripts intended for the Karigo Lab to add/edit `.annot` files for the bento mouse behavior annotation software created by Ann Kennedy: https://github.com/neuroethology/bentoMAT/blob/master/LICENSE.txt.
To use, just clone the repo.

## Usage
all2annot.m and led2annot.m work best one at a time on existing annotations, but if you want to add annotate several files at onces throw all the files into the same directory and run annotDir.m on that directory.
annotDir.m assumes:
- 1 video:1 usv call file: 1 desired annotation OR 
- 2 videos:1 usv call file: 1 desired annotation

This is a work in progress. If you have any issues or requests please message me over Slack
